## What is the purpose of this workshop?

This workshop will look to provide an existing standards landscape, roadmap and potential future work for how strong identity and strong authentication should work on the web. A successful workshop will be how to align recent W3C specifications  (WebAuthn, Verifiable Claims, Web Payments) and work that is ongoing in the W3C Credentials Community Group (DID, DIDAuth) along with IETF and ISO, as well as other existing community standards such as Open ID Connect, Oauth, SAML, etc.

## How can I attend?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the registration form (<span class="todo">[WBS](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/showwb) to be done</span>). We want to fill the room with people with practical experience of both Web and VR technologies.

Because the venue can accommodate unfortunately only 70 attendees, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on [these important dates](#dates). Registration will be first come, first served with position statements helping the Program Committee guide the acceptance of participants.

> * Finance and payment industries
> * Government services
> * Online platforms and service providers

## How can I suggest a presentation?
{: #position-statements}

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement (<span class="todo">[WBS](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/showwb) to be set up</span>) by the deadline (see [important dates](#dates)). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

* Your background in the main [topic areas](#topics) of the workshop.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

Note that your position statement submission is not intended to be an academic or conference paper, but is instead intended to educate the Program Committee on your interests and qualifications.
