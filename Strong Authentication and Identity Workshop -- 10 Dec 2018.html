    <h3 id="item01">Introduction to Workshop</h3>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt; scribe: manu</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Hi, my name is Wendy
    Seltzer, W3C - glad to welcome you here.<br />
    ... Thank you to Tony Nadalin and Microsoft for hosting
    us.<br />
    ... We're looking forward to the next two days of discussion,
    brainstorming, and socializing around Strong Auth and
    Identity.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Tony N. covers location of emergency exists,
    bathrooms, and parking. Assistance help, medical emergencies
    help, etc.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Very briefly,
    introducing the day and goals of the workshop at a high level -
    logistics, getting conversation going, etc.<br />
    ... We use IRC for realtime minuting and discussion... to
    connect to the wifi - MSFT Guest and use the code on the
    board.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>jeffh</cite>&gt; :)</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> We are thrilled to have
    everyone here - just a quick intro to W3C - our goal is to lead
    Web to its full potential... we work on voluntary consensus
    standards.<br />
    ... We put workshops like this on to bring people together,
    lots of work is happening here and outside of W3C - if we can
    be a forum for conversation, great, if it happens elsewhere,
    great.<br />
    ... We are not the exclusive endpoint of work, but one possible
    place to bring that work.<br />
    ... We are committed to Web for All.<br />
    ... We operate under Royalty-Free patent policy - this workshop
    is not Recommendation track, contributions here ar enot yet
    contributions that are goverened by patent policy. Our goal is
    that specs should be implementatable RF wrt. patents /
    copyright, etc.<br />
    ... We are a member consortium, we depend on members to
    participate - hope to keep that infrastructural work going -
    475 members from all sorts of places.<br />
    ... We operate workshops under a code of ethics and
    professional conduct - if anyone has an issue, find wseltzer or
    someone else in W3C Team. We want to make sure this environment
    enables everyone to feel safe, respected and heard.<br />
    ... We are working in difficult areas, standards work well for
    technical problem, good enough technical problem, and find a
    common resolution.<br />
    ... This all depends on you and the broader community to make
    sure these things work effectively.<br />
    ... We want to hear from everyone - you have cards, on those
    cards, you can write down questions/comments/concerns - we will
    use those to fill into Q/A and discussion that follows... we
    will also have dots for voting, mark areas of particular
    interest/concern.<br />
    ... We will have breakout sessions where we are gathering in
    smaller groups... W3C process for consensus ... these are
    preliminary directions/ideas... feel free to toss out ideas,
    but don't worry that if you're not in a group that you're going
    to miss the opportunity to provide critical input.<br />
    ... Also another part of getting together is social - Tony has
    found us space in a nearby on campus restaurant.<br />
    ... This is pay your own way, but pay your own way... ~$20
    minimum - interested and expecting to come tonight?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>tony-tr:</cite> There is good
    beer/wine.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Does anyone need a
    shuttle?</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>aaronpk</cite>&gt; looks like all
    hands raised except a few</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>kenrb</cite>&gt; almost everyone
    raised hands</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>tony-tr:</cite> I'll get a couple of
    shuttles.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Scribe notes roughly 60+ people raised their
    hands.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> You can make off the
    record statements... let us know if you want something to be
    off the record.<br />
    ... We can do queue management via q+<br />
    ... We can capture what's going on at workshop... everyone is
    capable of adding things to minutes.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>chrisboscolo</cite>&gt; sorry you
    can't be here in person, Manu!</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Thanks to the PC and
    Manu and the rest of the PC for putting all of this
    together.<br />
    ... Thanks to Tony and Microsoft for hosting us here... our
    goal is to move things quickly. Please add slides to google
    slide deck.<br />
    ... You can email me to put material on Google Slide
    deck...</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Kaliya:</cite> Hi, passed around cards
    to all of you - purpose of the workshop is to build mutual
    understanding across strong auth and identity projects, to do
    that, we're trying to gather as much input as possible.<br />
    ... We want to find potential connections between your work and
    work being presented.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide Directory for presentations -- <a href=
    "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oldmw0i1NKhJJwKflG4X9egqP6LLySA2">
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oldmw0i1NKhJJwKflG4X9egqP6LLySA2</a></p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Kaliya:</cite> We want questions,
    concerns, connections that you're seeing - we'll collect them
    after each of 7 presentations, we want to get a sense of the
    room about each of these.<br />
    ... Please put number on the card, and questions/concerns --
    this can be made anonymously.<br />
    ... We will collect them after each presentation.</p>
    <h3 id="item02">Understanding Verifiable Credentials</h3>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> We are going to go through
    this quickly, this is a quick overview.<br />
    ... When we talk about VCs, what do we mean by that?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Slides:</cite> <a href=
    "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11hm-ajsLzroPmA-BcC2TryqAhKsF3jZ_wxHDnyUi_pg/edit">
    https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11hm-ajsLzroPmA-BcC2TryqAhKsF3jZ_wxHDnyUi_pg/edit</a></p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> There are all sorts of
    things we use today quite successfully - we wanted to duplicate
    that in an electronic form.<br />
    ... We would show age/drivers license -- we're switching to
    education credentials - diplomas for example.<br />
    ... Diploma is interesting... I have PhD from Oregon, which was
    acquired by another school... that school doesn't exist
    anymore... that org might not exist anymore in any form... we
    want to make sure we cover use cases like that... we are
    interested in cryptographically verifiable credentials.<br />
    ... The work on VCs are just on a data model, not on protocol
    yet... issuer/verifier -- we don't define ecosystem
    normatively, but it's hard to talk about this w/o suggesting an
    ecosystem.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 3</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> When we talk about
    Verifiable credentials... issuer issues to holder... holder
    holds on to it... verifier asks for credential from
    holder.<br />
    ... In this model, a VC contains credential metadata, claims,
    and proofs... the identifiers can be cryptographically
    controllers, but issuers can also be identified.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>achughes</cite>&gt; burn: the verifier
    is the one seeking verification</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> What is a claim - one
    statement about a subject, Pat is over 21, for example.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; i|welcome you
    here|<a href=
    "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U5ArEC6lyZ5AS3UYiaKrO-fcXJuCcbE2A7JTjIGaKQA/edit?usp=sharing">Intro
    slides</a></p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> Here's an example in
    JSON-LD Syntax... we are defining a data model, and showing how
    you can use different syntaxes...<br />
    ... At some point there is a realization of the syntax... the
    main thing I want you to see is that there is an ID for the
    credential, there is some type information... from perspective
    of user... they are just using ProofOfAgeCredential... etc...
    we have an issuer field, when it's issued, the part in red is
    the actual claim.<br />
    ... We used to call this a "claim"... now we call this the
    "credentialSubject" - the id represents the subject of the
    claim... the property is ageOver and the value is 21.<br />
    ... There is a proof... the details don't matter... there is
    just a proof on there... we do have some suggestions on
    cryptographic proofs, but lots of this is
    flexible/variable.<br />
    ... We also talk about presentations... issuer, holder,
    verifier - it's actually a verifiable presentation by holder to
    verifier... it's for multiple credentials, often about same
    subject... identifier, some metadata, claims or some whole
    credentials... main idea w/ presentation is something that
    holder can pull from multiple credentials.<br />
    ... What are verifiable credentials and what are they not?</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 8</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> VCs allow an issuer provide
    a statement of fact... holders hold on to them, verifier can
    see if the statement hasn't been tampered with.<br />
    ... VCs don't represent verified truth... just who claimed
    what</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 9</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> This work is being
    standardized right now in VCWG... in scope is data model and
    syntaxes...<br />
    ... We are looking at JSON-LD... and JWT...<br />
    ... We do not have browsers in scope... we do not define
    protocol... we don't address "Identity on the Web"... we're
    just providing VCs.<br />
    ... out of scope work could be chartered in future WG...
    Credentials CG is looking at these items...<br />
    ... We have a spec, we're tryign to wrap up ZKP and JWT
    support... we have done some Horizontal Review (non official...
    expecting CR very soon.<br />
    ... We have test suites, use cases... (slide 10)<br />
    ... If you are curious about use cases... take a look at use
    cases document...<br />
    ... Details of pictures are W3C Member Confidential... in
    commerce, there are governments, banks, large websites, usign
    VCs.<br />
    ... In trade, DHS, CBP, Canadian Provinces... importer,
    exporter, etc. are some target use cases... real adoption
    here.</p>
    <p class='phone'>slide 13</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> Are there questions?</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; dirk_balfanz</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>dirk_balfanz:</cite> If you are conerned
    w/ data model - some credential, over 21, you want to know if
    *I* am over 21...</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> There is plenty of
    discussion around subject != holder.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JoeAndrieu:</cite> Use Cases talk about
    that use case - we are looking at things that are out of scope
    in protocol... but important to get a holistic view of
    things.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> Anyone can make any claim
    about anything... if you look at the ID in red, that's a DID,
    this is where you may start seeing use for DIDs.<br />
    ... Control over the identifier is an interesting question
    we're going to hear about soon...</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>tony:</cite> In looking at the current
    spec, it still looks like JSON-LD is the language, it looks
    like you're going to wrap regular JSOn or other types of
    JWTs/CWTs - get a little concerned... those get quite large,
    little concerned around size of expression.<br />
    ... We're not looking for just users making these statements,
    we're looking for devices... concerned around size of
    claims.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>burn:</cite> Is that a question or
    statement?<br />
    ... I'm not going to talk about the merits of one format of the
    other... as a Chair, we have been asking for feedback from
    others for the entire lifetime of WG... we do have people
    looking at other formats.<br />
    ... We do have folks that are looking to support other
    expression formats.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Oliver:</cite> We have a pull request in
    for JWTs - we do have some shorter expression avoid duplication
    in JSON-LD... issuer could become iss field.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Slides are here -- <a href=

    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> Hi, I'm Kim, CTO of
    Learning Machine - work in educational credentials... co-chair
    of W3C Credentials CG - also DIF Steering Committee.<br />
    ... What is a DID? It's a new type of URl that is globally
    unique, highly available, presistent, cryptographically
    verifiable, and doesn't require a centralized admin.<br />
    ... In education use cases, we want the recipient of a
    credential to be identified using a DID.<br />
    ... A DID is an identifier for a subject.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 3]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> here we have did:x:123 as
    the identifier for the subject.<br />
    ... What does a DID look like?</p>
    <p class='phone'>slide 4</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> we have a scheme "did:",
    then "DID Method", then did specific string.<br />
    ... There are examples of what these look like at the bottom of
    the page...<br />
    ... Globally unique identifier - in many of these cases, you
    can self-create your identifier... prove that you control it,
    no central admin can take it away from you.<br />
    ... Each DID Method must specify a set of mechanisms - Create,
    Read, Update, Delete (aka revoke)</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 5]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> One critical part - DIDs
    resolve to DID Documents - we have a Veres One identifier here
    - document it resolves to - contains authentication mechanisms,
    public key material, services...<br />
    ... markus_sabadello is goign to talk about that next... DID
    Resolver is retrieving DID Document.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 6]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> So, DIDs resolve to DID
    Documents... let's look at specific DID resolution
    process.<br />
    ... This is saying we're using the BTCR method spec, run it
    through the universal resolver, produces a DID Document.<br />
    ... identifier tells you which block, which transaction, to
    find the transaction in.<br />
    ... Resolver knows, per method spec, how to get information,
    how to return this thing.<br />
    ... so, DID Document has keys, authentication, services,
    signatures, timestamps.</p>
    <p class='phone'>slide DID Document</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> This document has been
    incubated at RWoT and IIW, currently draft in W3C CCG,
    protocols and prototypes at DIF, there is a DID Method
    Registry, DID Auth, DID Resolver...<br />
    ... We'd like to discuss a DID Working Group at this
    Workshop.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>tonyn:</cite> What do you expect to
    standardize?<br />
    ... There doesn't seem to be cross-blockchain interop... I need
    different DIDs on every blockchain... who is going to run the
    registry... concerned around transparency of resolvers...</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> Interop first - that's the
    big part... what's the content of the DID Document, that
    describes how interop is possible...<br />
    ... DID Auth, for example, needs that document....</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> There are a couple
    of different issues here - DID authenticates DID DOcument,
    strongly make claim about DID Document... that document can
    contain other key material from other places... including keys
    that are compatible with say a different blockchain w/
    different proof formats, PGP keys in there, information that
    lets you allow you to leverage FIDO.<br />
    ... There are things like sigma proofs, ZKPs, private keys in
    one curve equivalent to private keys in antoehr group... it's
    premature to pick a method, maybe at some point the market will
    say there is one two or three that are dominate... but reality
    now is that there are multiple DID methods.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> We are starting to
    categorize DID Methods.. BTCR and IPLD are ones where, if you
    are comfortable w/ using that technology, you can create them
    and use them in some way... depending on registry
    authentication, you can start using that now... truly
    self-sovereign identifiers, I create them, no one can take them
    away from me.<br />
    ... In other cases, private/permissioned blockchain, those
    enable different properties - for example Guardian models...
    batch registration of individuals... some depend on properties
    of the blockchain itself... which use cases argue for which...
    we don't do guidance yet, DIF may do that... W3C is not in that
    role.<br />
    ... People will have those questions... you don't want to use
    something on a blockchain that can't be rewritten... part of
    strength of it, something we're getting feedback on
    ecosystem.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>tony:</cite> Who is going to run the

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>Loqi</cite>&gt; Slides has -1 karma
    over the last year</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> Hi, working in CCG and
    DIF, and Sovrin... DID Auth is more of a concept rather than a
    spec... makes a lot of sense to have a concept... DPKI for
    DIDs... and what they enable.<br />
    ... Using a DID Resolver to authenticate - you have DID, you
    have key material associated with that... control the
    identifier... not about proving we're over the age of XYZ, we
    just prove that we have control over a DID.<br />
    ... We worked on a paper around Rebooting the Web of Trust...
    looked at DID Auth - Kim noted authentication.<br />
    ... Authentication block points to public key - who has control
    of the DID? If you have public key information, you can know
    that anyone that has private key is authenticated.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide: DID Auth
    Example Architecture]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> This is one example for
    uPort - web page - mobile app authentication...<br />
    ... With a mobile app, private key corresponding to DID, I can
    provide response to QRCode - post it back to web page...
    important, web page uses DID Resolver to find DID, then find
    public key, then verify that the signature on the
    authentication was signed correctly.<br />
    ... This is just one of the possible flows.<br />
    ... We tried to analyze this stuff - different scenarios /
    different flows - there are many, so DID Auth isn't just one
    thing... it's a family of things that are being explored.<br />
    ... There are many transports, HTTP, QR, etc....<br />
    ... There are many more flows... observation - we were able to
    draw all of these flows where there are two parties... if we
    look at traditional models, we usually have 3 parties... but
    this one has 2.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 7]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> I control a certain
    identifier - trust relying party - individual - all sorts of
    different transports...</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 8]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> There are also people
    that are using different data formats internally... we will
    reuse things, but as I said, DID Auth is not trying to come up
    w/ a new authentication protocol... but reuse where
    possible.<br />
    ... I have seen JWTs... we can also see JSON-LD VCs...
    self-issued VC....<br />
    ... We have been thinking a lot about OIDC + DID... also
    looking at WebAuthn + DID...</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 10]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> We've done some initial
    thinking - working w/ OpenID Connect protocol, where we use
    self-issued OpenID ... one way this could be done is to have
    personal openID connect provider... protocol could be used,
    similar with WebAuthn... FIDO... could reuse that.<br />
    ... There are other experiments around DID-TLS, DID-based HTTP
    Signatures... DID-based PGP... using DIDs in SSH.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 11]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> Some things to consider
    for the workshop - how would a DID Auth relate to VC exchange
    protocol?<br />
    ... Other DID Auth principles... We may want to meet some
    principles, otherwise it's not DID Auth... for example,
    identifier stays the same... rotate keys, change service
    endpoints, change OID endpoints, authmethod, but we continue to
    always be able to prove control of the same identifier.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Questions from the
    room?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JohnB:</cite> I may beat Tony to some of
    these questions ... In a number of the flows that you put up,
    potentially they are a step backwards from a security
    perspective because they're phishable... we need to make sure
    we're not going backwards from a security perspective.<br />
    ... I would even step back a bit further and question - is the
    use case for DID Auth actually authentication, or is it more
    appropriately proving presentment of VCs.<br />
    ... We do have pairwise privacy preserving WebAuthn... even
    Apple is deploying it... do we actually need to present
    correlatable claim, or should we look at the best
    mixture?<br />
    ... Some have said we need new authentication method when that
    may not be the best path.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> Lot of questions - let's
    keep the benefits of existing things... not be phishable...
    concept of DID Auth is that we have an identifier that cannot
    be taken away from me, I can rotate keys, I can rotate metadata
    out... I think OIDC or WebAuthn don't provide that out of the
    box.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JohnB:</cite> The argument that you need
    to rotate credentials is making presumptions about how they're
    stored... I don't buy into the premise that a DID is required
    because you need to rotate private keys, not arguing that there
    are not use cases for DIDs, let's find the right use cases for
    them.<br />
    ... For purely pairwise pseudonymous auth, I don't believe a
    DID having a public key published is a requirement.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Daniel:</cite> A couple of things on the
    business side (from Microsoft perspective)... would love it if
    people used LinkedIn for everything (Microsoft property) -
    Universities didn't really want to sign up to single entities,
    because of corporate identifiers controlled by something other
    than University.<br />
    ... So, there is a strong business use case for DIDs... large
    entities that don't want other large entities to lock them in
    via identifiers.<br />
    ... There are also use cases around progressive trust... you
    start out pseudonymous, but then upgrade over time. For
    example, FIDO doesn't cover the use case for expressing
    services around DID Documents... granting access to my data
    storage service.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Tony:</cite> I get concerned around
    methodology for DIDs... you don't actually know if person that
    created the key is doing the DID Auth itself... you can do this
    in FIDO... authenticators is a drvice that you control. I'm not
    seeing end to end comprehension of how you keep keys safe and
    to the actual creator of the keys. How do you prove that
    situation in DID Auth.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> I think part of the
    problem here, we're overinflating the use of keys, for
    simplicity purposes, you see DID Document up there - presuming
    that private key is in a file some place...<br />
    ... That is a gross simplifciation, we can keep separate
    keys... we don't call it a signature block, there might be a
    variety of different types of proof... for example, if I issue
    Verifiable Credential covering you for 1 million dollars... I
    want a higher spec of authenticator/proofs before I give you
    that verifiable claim.<br />
    ... DID Documents enable you to use all of this stuff... we
    need people that have experience with these systems. All the
    perils of mixing authn w/ authz... but at some point we need
    something like a DID DOcument... just because someone asks for
    a VC or other things, doens't mean I have to give it to
    them/comply... or they have to accept.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Dirk:</cite> Where do you see DID and
    DID Auth fit into the larger picture... I think I understand
    VCs... I want to prove my age, SSN, I thought DIDs were a means
    to an end...<br />
    ... One way I could do that, who are you?, I could provide DID
    and DID Auth, prove that's who I am... find something in DID
    Document, claim I'm over 21? Am I seeing that right... how is
    DID connected to VCs?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Markus:</cite> We don't put VCs in
    public ledgers...<br />
    ... DID Documents are for looking up key material and
    services.... not VCs.<br />
    ... There are no claims in DID Document, only metadata required
    to verify VC material...<br />
    ... DID Auth is just a high level concept so far...<br />
    ... No assumptions about documents are in ledger, where keys
    are stored, where hardware wallets are... etc.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> We have a queue... and
    then break...</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; JoeAndrieu: None

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>weiler</cite>&gt; manu: I hear in this
    discussion a perception of an either-or thing. the experiments
    going on right now .... there is an auth flow that takes a FIDO
    authenticator, puts the credentials in the DID document</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JoeAndrieu:</cite> For VCs and DID and
    DID Auth - none of those is sufficient for identity
    assurance... whether the key is on a hard drive, or on a
    hardware authenticator, we can't prove that person controlling
    device is the person... it's a strong factor.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>weiler</cite>&gt; ... There is a a lot
    of work around blending these models rather than picking
    one.</p>

    two American operating in squads<br />
    ... interoperations were walking over from one tent to
    another<br />
    ... Afganistan had 1200 operational aircraft that knows how to
    broadcast communications<br />
    ... but you could not do this for Marines was a standing
    joke<br />
    ... I want to specifically talk about a system we developed at
    Microsoft called Malga<br />
    ... you have lots of patient data and you want to assemble a
    data cube<br />
    ... to have a single view of everything about the patient<br />
    ... in doing that you quickly come up against lots of issues
    about identity<br />
    ... I will talk about four of them<br />
    ... while Amalga was meant to extract data about patients from
    electronic medical systems as well as from real time
    feeds<br />
    ... extract EMR, many systems are oriented around
    payments<br />
    ... have to go through payer who was paying for this<br />
    ... or else it is difficult to extract certain kinds of
    data<br />
    ... have to extract the payer first to get to the
    diagnosis<br />
    ... Identity for providers is obvious<br />
    ... give them access to patient information<br />
    ... but something else goes on here<br />
    ... much patient data is subject to interpretation<br />
    ... you need to know who the interpreter is<br />
    ... next is the data itself<br />
    ... Amalga had origins in system done at George Washington
    School of Medicine and Life Sciences<br />
    ... because of its geo location in Washington DC<br />
    ... it has access to many kinds of patients<br />
    ... one CATScan file was originated at one hospital and passed
    to another<br />
    ... need to make sure it's same patient and scan<br />
    ... Amalga collecting data from many sources<br />
    ... and identities of patients were different; mechanism to
    coalesce identities is needed<br />
    ... Patients who are largely treated through emergency rooms,
    and each ER visit generates a new ID<br />
    ... I created for them an inference system to assemble IDs into
    a single individual<br />
    ... that is story and the state of affairs as of 2016<br />
    ... to the best of my knowledge, this situation has not
    changed<br />
    ... so I hope folks in this room can fix this problem</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Wendy:</cite> We have a challenge in
    front of us<br />
    ... any questions for Allen?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Scott:</cite> economic challenges

    <p class='phone'><cite>Allen:</cite> not change the data<br />

    ... next up is Jim Maslowski</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Speaker:</cite> Jim Masloski<br />
    ... I work with DHS<br />
    ... we were developing proof of concept for certificates of
    origin<br />
    ... doing input process<br />
    ... a group was tasked with process</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 12 from
    group deck]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Speaker:</cite> brought in different
    people, US Customs, trade people, customs brokers,
    importers<br />
    ... parties responsible for capturing and setting the
    information<br />
    ... sat down to figure out how to do this on a distributed
    ledger<br />
    ... We were in a room for a day and a half to outline our
    taskst<br />
    ... how to target this process<br />
    ... we started with 35 ideas and narrowed down to 5-6
    simplistic ideas<br />
    ... we found out who the actors were, what you would need who
    would help develop the process<br />
    ... Looking at import and export processes<br />
    ... it was an eye opener for the group to see how to capture
    that information, how it comes to you, and what the legal
    requirements are<br />
    ... we had the legal group with us<br />
    ... always interesting when we say we want to capture x but
    legal says it's against the law to do so<br />
    ... we went in knowing it would be a challenge and a
    work-in-progress proof of concept<br />
    ... when we got through ti<br />
    ... I have put a transportation document up on the screen</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [slide 13]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Speaker:</cite> we focused on the
    verifiable credentials and ID management<br />
    ... how to verify who was making claim and capture that
    information<br />
    ... this happens to be a load of light bulbs<br />
    ... certain data a gov't makes available, certain information
    stays private<br />
    ... had to figure out how to make a legal, compliant
    distributed ledger that improves the supply chain<br />
    ... took agnostic approach<br />
    ... cross-platform<br />
    ... look at number of parties needing access to the system; we
    used DIDs to identify the brokers, suppliers, US customers, and
    used Verifiable Credentials<br />
    ... with distributed ledger we could identity products coming
    in, the provenance<br />
    ... communication between agency and supplier<br />
    ... supply chain side, we could get supplier into the front
    end<br />
    ... supplier certified<br />
    ... we added to transaction that crossed border, ID who owned,
    who is responsible, so then US Customs could ask questions on
    it<br />
    ... we provided supporting documentation<br />
    ... as a valid pre-trade claim<br />
    ... from that standpoint it went well<br />
    ... Biggest challenge was taking into consideration the legal
    side<br />
    ... hard to grab the information the way the laws are
    written<br />
    ... we were able to take advantage of the distributed ledger to
    make these claims<br />
    ... Looking at clusters of information; does that org exists
    and is it an importer<br />
    ... how do you certify this is a load of lumber, or an
    automobile<br />
    ... it all hinged on the DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and have
    a process to capture the information and the proof<br />
    ... there was significant time savings on these requests<br />
    ... for example, where is the T-shirt manufacturer<br />
    ... one invoice, one sku<br />
    ... to claim differential rate; they would supply a pallet
    worth of documentation<br />
    ... with this process they could make the claim with info that
    was on the ledger<br />
    ... a huge advantage<br />
    ... I liked it</p><br />
    .,..from a trade standpoint, we look forward to see what W3C
    does for DIDs

    ... I recorded every conversation because everyone spoke in

    ... then I got off security beat<br />

    ... I went to conference in Philadephia; sessions on X509<br />
    ... other side were LDAP guys yelling at each other<br />
    ... replication issues on the LDAP side, X509 is dead; they are

    ... All these big companies dictated the reference architecture
