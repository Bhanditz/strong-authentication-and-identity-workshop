    <h3 id="item01">Introduction, Day 2</h3>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt; scribe: manu</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> Welcome back everyone,
    we're tracking all input, we're going to start our day 2 of the
    workshop.<br />
    ... We have taken cards from yesterday into
    questions/statements and we're going to do dot voting on
    those... Kaliya will explain what we're doing next.<br />
    ... Great agenda of additional talks/breakouts - exploring
    cultural perspectives, avoiding mistakes/minefields, breakouts
    discussing ideas, one of our goals it to help W3C figure out
    what we should do next.<br />
    ... That might be community groups, to incubate work, it might
    be working groups to standardize work, it might be work to be
    sent to other organizations, or input to other W3C WGs.<br />
    ... A key takeaway here becomes the next directions of what
    we'd like to collectively do next with all of this input.<br />
    ... Lots of place for discussion in the roadmap, where we see
    the future and how to get there. We wrap up at 4pm today so
    folks can catch flights.<br />
    ... I heard lots of great ideas and still lots of tension,
    concerns from folks focused on authentication that the identity
    isn't necessarily tied into authentication, concerns on
    identifiers (work being characterized wrongly, misunderstood) -
    if we're not looking at the right use cases, people come to
    different conclusions. We have time to work out differences in
    understanding, where is the agreement on the components of the
    stack?<br />
    ... One outcome could be that we're trying to solve different
    problems, perhaps the technologies can coexist... we can offer
    insights to one another even if we're not working on the same
    piece of the problem.<br />
    ... If we have issues with things others are working on - let's
    focus on constructive criticism, how can we all help to make
    the Web work better by building the right components around
    authentication and identity.</p>
    <h3 id="item02">Dot Voting on concerns and potential work
    items.</h3>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Kaliya:</cite> We took output from
    conversation yesterday and crystalized them into some
    statements and put them on these forms.<br />

    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> Hi, Takashi from JCB --
    before starting presentation, just noting that I am not a
    native English speaker.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 2</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 4</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; slide 5</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> In ecommerce - in B2C -
    Amazong is close to Rakuten.<br />
    ... There are a number of fragmented identity platforms iN
    Japan.<br />
    ... Also, differnet payment methods.</p>
    <p class='phone'>slide 7</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> Big Japanese companies
    have siloed solutions - six big companies - user has to know
    timetable... but just redirects to companies website.<br />
    ... Driving license has a dominant position in Japan... as an
    identity mechanism.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; slide 9</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> Japanese government want
    to expand usage of "My Number" card for Japanese Social ID
    System... but most Japanese people don't use this card - only
    10%.<br />
    ... We have a strong need for loose ID federation in Japanese
    Market...</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 10</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> Large companies seem to
    want to take a dominant position on Social ID...<br />
    ... Governments seem to want Drivers license style
    approaches.<br />
    ... To achieve this, we need a scheme for DIDs and Self
    Sovereign identity especially consent management.<br />
    ... Thank you for your attention.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>MikeJones:</cite> Mike Jones from
    Microsoft, I know that Yahoo Japan and KDDI implement OpenID
    Connect. Are they using that to interoperably login at other
    Japanese sites, or is it mostly silos even though they are
    using that federation protocol?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Takashi:</cite> Interop is not so great,
    in Japan, every company uses Social ID using Yahoo, ??,
    Facebook, and NTTDoCoMo...</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>shigeya:</cite> Let me talk about
    structured IDs, little different from user identity</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; [presentation
    starts at slide 13]</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>shigeya:</cite> you know about bar codes
    (slide: bag of mints -- comes from GS1)<br />
    ... GS1 - they do the UPC - GS1 has a database...<br />
    ... GS1 standards - identify, capture, and share - slide 16</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 16</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>shigeya:</cite> There are multiple
    formats to identify, capture, and share... barcode is only one
    of them, can be expressed in URLs.<br />
    ... GS1 has identification keys - domains... trade items
    (GTIN), logistics (SSCC), Assets (GIAI), and locations
    (GLNs)<br />
    ... Companies assign GLNs to locatins like factories...
    examples of GS1 identifiers.<br />
    ... These are all expressible as URNs... urn:epc:id:...<br />
    ... These are not DIDs, but they kind of look the same,
    different domain.<br />
    ... There are also physical representations - barcodes, RFID,
    there are different formats/syntaxes.<br />
    ... So let's look at applications... GS1 Lightweight Messaging
    Standard for Verification... RESTful interface to resolve GS1
    IDs... use case - US Drug Supply Chain.<br />
    ... We're interested in using Verifiable Credentials for
    this.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Slide 21</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>shigeya:</cite> Here are some
    difficulties with resolution services - Object Naming System...
    DNS based pat of GS1 key to server mapping... not used other
    than for research purposes.<br />
    ... GS1 Discovery Services - centrlaized - map keys to servers,
    suspended until well-defined demands from industry.<br />
    ... but lately, there is renewed interest in mapping between
    identifiers and associated data, together with verification of
    identifiers.<br />
    ... GS1 is the standard on product and business entity
    identification,DID focuses on digital identity, we need a
    cyber-physical link other than humans.<br />
    ... DIDs could be used in the "id" fields in DID related
    standards.<br />
    ... There is a good intersection between DIDs and GS1 work.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Pam:</cite> You talked about resolution
    and mapping - are those different things in your taxonomy?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>shigeya:</cite> Mapping and discovery is
    ... different.<br />
    ... RFID is ... RFID leaks information... but information
    record is somewhere else, stored on the server, that
    information may be on a single server or multiple servers...
    discovery service integrates all these data flows together.</p>

    ... 50 billion machines coming down the pipeline.<br />
    ... The Right to Work Online -- cannot be done w/o this
    technologies...<br />
    ... I work w/ displaced people - there are more people

    <p class='phone'>Slide 3</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Pindar:</cite> These people are away
    from their home countries... global climate change makes it
    worse... legal certainty - do they have it... these people are
    going to grow to 700M in the future<br />
    ... There is a potential billion person market here covering
    ... what about the lawful approach (there are non-lawful
    approaches to solve these problems)</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; "We're all
    migrants, we just don't know it yet"</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Pindar:</cite> Examples of this, after
    WWI, if your country no longer existed, passports doesn't work.
    How can we create a "Right to Work Online"? It's not a
    Sovereign view, it's not about borders, it's about
    topology.<br />
    ... How many people are in My Number? 10% of Japan.<br />
    ... Aadhaar is over 1 billion users... great stats, interesting
    ruling on constitutionality.<br />
    ... Aadhaar has issues, but it's deployed.<br />
    ... 50B devices online - we need to be concerned about
    scale.<br />
    ... There are other mechanisms in China - Social Credit System,
    Real Name Electronic ID, Fintech, Common CLOUD.... identities
    issued by governments to citizens.<br />
    ... There is the Belt and Road Initiative - when you cross
    borders, law is defined by borders - when you cross 65-68 legal
    jurisdiction... Hong Kong is looking at digital roots.<br />
    ... We have 3-5 times more internet capacity into Hong Kong
    than all of China combined - how is this leveraged?<br />
    ... What is the competitive landscale, market structure,
    business models... what are the fundamental tensions between
    geography and topology?<br />
    ... We are mixing fire and ice - government issued - year
    1648... in Hong Kong year 2047 -- self administered<br />
    ... No nation below mathematics... physical border in
    borderless world... self-administered IDs...<br />
    ... Here's the belt and road blockchain - only deals w/
    corporate identifiers, legal in switzerland, identifier system
    for corporates, self administered IDs, the most important thing
    is Self-Administered IDs, why do you need them?<br />
    ... Companies don't have a right to anonymity - they have to be
    registered, they have to pay tax.<br />
    ... We need a golden source of data, we need to know where law
    applies, that's one of the things that Hong Kong is famous
    for...<br />
    ... As a technical community - consistency - Hong Kong - golden
    copies, grounded by government institutions, use it, assign
    copies of data, have less legal responsibility and
    liability.<br />
    ... to scale cloud services, need identifiers system to allow
    different cloud systems to scale.<br />
    ... This is why we call them Self-Administered Identifiers -
    corporates/individuals... Sovrerign states - Fire... dynamic
    violence.<br />
    ... in our Internet view - borderless... ice...
    cryptographically strong static violence...<br />
    ... We need to understand consent - freeze, not move -
    different property that does not require rule of law -<br />
    ... legal certainty - many of us that do contracts don't see
    the light of day - computing engine of court system - interpret
    run legal code... computational code - cryptographic
    consistency - we can have a different type of discussion.</p>

    Tom Jones and Mary Hodder's slides</a></p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Tom:</cite> What you see when you look
    at this, Authentication of a User has to be different ...
    Decentralized Identity on steroids - pieces of identity are
    spread throughout space.<br />
    ... How to bring things back together again... talks to strong
    enough idea that we're trying to present to this group.<br />
    ... Authentication and Authorization - separate and needs to
    stay separate.<br />
    ... WebAuthn comes up more like Authorization...<br />
    ... The idea is that in this use case, pretty high assurance
    that someone is over 21 if they need to buy some alcohol or
    some other restricted element online.<br />
    ... We're going to talk about these 4 actors - consumer that
    wants restricted resource, supplier that has resource, verifier
    of claim of majority (sort of like Verifiable Credentials
    meaning), this verifier can validate binding between user and
    claim.<br />
    ... I'll try to use validate when I say that and verified when
    I say verified claim.<br />
    ... What about the right of a regulator agency?<br />
    ... One of the most interesting cases is DEA position on
    drugs...</p>
    <p class='phone'>@@@: When you say regulatory agency, do you
    mean provider of claim?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JohnB:</cite> What requirements are
    there?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>MaryHodder:</cite> For state of
    California, board of brewery, had to do a deep identity
    verification for brewing... tap room, physical location, sell
    things through website and people can come in and pick up...
    brewing operations, they spot check, they don't look at our
    records for every single sale.<br />
    ... Often people flash a license... employees ar edoing that
    check, there is no recording except through website
    purchases... no one is even providing this.<br />
    ... They are literally clicking a button, which is not good,
    flashing license... but there is no real recording/requirement
    that feds and state of california require for alcohol
    purchases.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Tom:</cite> If you are buying alcohol,
    you can have different requirements for different types of
    purchases.<br />
    ... The specific rules differ by state - online use case, they
    will try to find rules that will work for all states.<br />
    ... Last part - provider of late binding tokens and client-side
    code.<br />
    ... Smart card, TPM, etc. precondition is that you have a
    consumer that has a late binding token that has it, they have
    an over 21 claim, and finally they have a consumer that already
    established an ID with some supplier.<br />
    ... They are already online... that's where we are ... two
    different use cases to look at this - supplier sends request
    through user asking for a claim... user has a claim... user
    sends it back.<br />
    ... It's not verified - typically, supplier ... use late
    binding token to be attached to claim, late binding token is
    attached.<br />
    ... If you are an OpenID person, this is just front-channel
    authentication... at this point, we have provided a service to
    supplier, we expect supplier to receive validated claim.<br />
    ... This is small, 5-10 cents - standard practice - fraud
    detection circuit.<br />
    ... Second scenario, something that looks like a back channel -
    consumer himself has to go and get validated claim.<br />
    ... Gets validation, gets claim, supplier gets it.<br />
    ... This is traditional advertising model... bound to
    session.<br />
    ... Fail paths - fairly obvious, user doesn't get verified, or
    fails validation at supplier<br />
    ... The real point is that the user gets to decide what
    attributes he sends based on what he's doing at the current

    describes a data structure but doesn't define how to do

    <p class='phone'><cite>mike:</cite> that's a step in the right
    direction, i don't have preconceived boundaries on what the

    <p class='phone'><cite>manu:</cite> i'm disappointed with the
    line of argumentation that some of a vocal minority in the JWT
    community (mostly from Microsoft) are making... that Working

    ... in that sense, it's strange to me that doing a data model
    is not enough for a WG<br />
    ... it's a very strange argument<br />
    ... the second thing is there are a number of companies that
    are building and deploying verifiable creds to real customers

    ... this is not a theoretical exercise, there are organizations
    involved i nthis work, and i'll note that those taking
    exception to the WG are not building these systems<br />
    ... so as someone who is leading a company writing this code

    going to help greatly that ensuring this market as it's growing

    . . . seems like most of us aren't familiar with
    attestation<br />
    . . . [describing slide] trying to create building blocks for
    IoT. One of the services would be for attestation.
    <p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> the attestation is that
    you are speaking with the device you think you are, iun a way
    you can trust.<br />
    ... [slide 2]<br />
    ... these are not the only attestation suppliers. As in the
    example of the supply chain, sometimes you need to know the
    identity of the things you are dealing with.<br />
    ... There is a working group around RATS, EATS is the
    container.<br />
    ... smaller devices may be limited to 64 kB of RAM.<br />
    ... [slide 3] different systems have different ways of
    expressing claims.<br />
    ... encodings, assigning keys, running sets of PKIs, for the
    policies that will be validated, these are all part of the
    trust model.<br />
    ... my device may be making claims, but we may want those
    claims aggregated with others.<br />
    ... when authenticating to a system, the device can attest that
    it meets the appropriate security level.<br />
    ... [slide 4] when you are talking ot a 3rd party, can you just
    trust them? don't you want to go further?<br />
    ... If they have the proper credentials, but the software has
    been altered, that is only one possible problem that
    attestation may address.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChrisBoscolo:</cite> are there any 3rd
    party audits available? is there a way for outsiders to know

    will be wrapping up in a few months.<br />
    ... There is a need for other things to be incubated [slide
    2]<br />
    ... this is where we allow the flexibility. DID Methods are not
    ready to move into specification.<br />
    ... there has been lots of discussion about what should be in
    or out of the DID Document<br />
    ... [slide 3] Once we can use VCs with DIDs, there are a lot of
    use cases and special examples that can be explored.<br />
    ... there are many questions around protocol and consent that
    are unanswered.<br />
    ... Doubt we will get to the bottom few in the next several
    years.<br />
    ... how do we turn this into a service of value.<br />
    ... lots of discussion about DID Auth, there is a Rebooting Web

    ... [slide 4] OCAP solves a number of problems around ambient
    authority.<br />
    ... Credential requests and exchanges are out of scope.<br />
    ... cryptographic proofs is a big confusing area, we don't just
    use signatures anymore.<br />

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; manu, you wanted to
    note that all of this is future work once we get DID WG (data
    model in place) and that all of this stuff isn't happening in a
    vacuum, we're being very careful</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>manu:</cite> just to clarify, this is a
    roadmap, it is future-looking. What we need is a working group
    specifically for data model and syntax.<br />
    ... the other thing to note is that therte are a variety of
    things being worked on in the ccg.<br />
    ... these things are not happening in a vacuum, a lot of work
    is going on around these things.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Dirk:</cite> how do all of these pieces
    hang together? the verifiable credentials and DIDs, how do they
    hang together?<br />
    ... Would the credential be issued to a DID?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> Yes the claim would
    be issued to the DID. There are correlation issues with using
    an identifier this way.<br />
    ... the process of a verifier getting the information they need
    during presentation might be iterative, leading to trust
    between two parties.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Dirk:</cite> so, if I only have one DID
    that satisfies this information, I have to disclose that
    one?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> yes, there is some
    correlation leakage there.<br />
    ... with BTCR there is a very anonymous scenario where DIDs are
    uses more selectively.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Dirk:</cite> If I want to prove my
    birthdate to two people, do I need to share my DID?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> No, the Sovrin
    solution allows for pairwise DIDs and zero-knolwedge proofs
    about the claims you are sharing.</p>
    <p class='phone'>Dalys Sebastian: how does DID resolution work
    from an application developer point of view?</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wseltzer</cite>&gt; s/???/Dalys/</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> there are a couple
    of different approaches. Markus did a resolver that did
    VeresOne, BTCR, Sovrin DIDs as a first step.<br />
    ... it was a plugin architecture that allowed for
    expansion.<br />
    ... interoperability between DIDs is difficult between methods
    because the root of trust for resolution is different for
    different cases.<br />
    ... a developer may have a resolver and they would need to
    choose the plugins they need to use.<br />
    ... you may have a number of credentials from a number of
    parties.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; JoeAndrieu, you
    wanted to reiterate that proof of control is just a single
    factor</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>JoeAndrieu:</cite> fetishization of
    proof of control of a DID leads to poor understanding. There is
    potentially a lot more to a proof than a single attribute.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; kimhd, you wanted to
    comment on did resolution</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> VCs can only prove
    that someone said something, not that what they said is
    true.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>kimhd:</cite> each DID method must say
    how to resolve it, along with the CRUD operations.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> but all of the
    methods have something in common. With BTCR there is a lot of
    magic happening on the back end, developers don't care about
    that.<br />
    ... they only care that the resolver did the right thing.<br />
    ... one more thing, these aren't standards yet.</p>

    ... we have a few projects over the coming years, but now we're

    ... the contract orientation and the elevation of terms of use
    means it is very difficult for self sovereign identity to
    triumph.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> thank you Marie. There
    are snacks. let's break. we will reconvene after the break.
    maybe some breakouts. not much time left.<br />
    ... only a half hour left. mostly for breakout groups.</p>
    <h3 id="item10">Final Remarks and Breakouts</h3>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> we have smart people
    and a lot of work to do. possibly not a good sense of exactly
    what is next.<br />
    ... lots of interest in interop, a DIDWG charter, etc.<br />
    ... we can continue the discussion with the mailing list from
    this workshop.</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>manu</cite>&gt; -1 on new CG for
    DIDs</p>
    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>manu</cite>&gt; -1 on another workshop
    :) (except continuing work in RWoT, CCG, etc.)</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>wseltzer:</cite> we want to continue to
    develop solutions to these hard problems.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>weiler:</cite> limited time
    available<br />
    ... looking for 2 to 4 conversations.<br />
    ... who wants to choose a topic?<br />
    ... vote for confusion resolution<br />
    ... open ID connect DID?<br />
    ... 2<br />
    ... translator for Ethereuem openid?<br />
    ... no<br />
    ... a login with DID button?<br />
    ... no<br />
    ... Selective permissionless delegation?<br />
    ... no<br />
    ... these are not giving us discussion ideas.<br />
    ... the ones with the most agree and disagree are the
    chartering discussions<br />
    ... one of the breakouts is the DID WG chartering.<br />
    ... who doesn't want to go to that one?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>Dirk:</cite> we've talked a lot about
    solutions, not sure what problems we are trying to solve.</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>weiler:</cite> chartering and use cases,
    is there a third?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>ChristopherA:</cite> is there anybody
    else interested in the true anonymous use cases?</p>
    <p class='phone'><cite>weiler:</cite> that's three.</p>
